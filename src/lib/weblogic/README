WebLogic libs
============

wlfullclient - taken from a 10.3 WebLogic install, used for all things WL
wlcipher.jar - taken from a 10.3 WebLogic install, used for SSL connections
DemoTrust.jks - taken from a 12.1 install, required for SSL

WebLogic is ridiculous and doesn't have a neat HTTP API by default, so we
need to use WL libraries to invoke enterprise MBeans.
